#  Multiplication Calculator (Python CLI)
A simple command-line app that calculates the **product of any numbers** entered by the user.  
Enter as many numbers as you want, and type `stop` when you’re done — the program will calculate the total product.

---

##  Features
-  Accepts unlimited numbers  
-  Calculates their total multiplication  
-  Stops input when you type `stop`  
-  Handles invalid inputs gracefully  
-  Runs directly in the terminal  

---

##  How It Works
1. The program continuously asks for number input.
2. Each number is added to a list.
3. When you type `stop`, it multiplies all numbers in the list.
4. The result is displayed.

---

##  Usage
Run the script using:

```bash
python multiplication_calculator.py
Example output:
